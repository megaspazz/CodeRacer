# CodeRacer
A multiplayer online typing game where users can race each other in typing code snippets. Try it for yourself [here](https://www.coderacer.org "CodeRacer")! (when it's not down).

### To-do List:
* Write an actual README.
* Fix the UI.
  - Give players an icon or a color.
  - New banner and/or icon?
* Make the game more intuitive to play.  Perhaps we can have an instructions page, or just help bubbles on the game page.
* Update the server code to save everything.
  - Save the stats for each race.
* Implement login sessions
* Make password storage not terrible.  We could also give a warning when registering that it's not secure for now.
* Create a new event for when a race times out so that clients will know when they timed out, since the server currently just deletes the race from memory when it times out.
* Practice mode (single-player)
